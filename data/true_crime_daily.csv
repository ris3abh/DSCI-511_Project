McHugh sentenced each to serve seven to 14 years for the assault charges, plus a consecutive three to seven years for child endangerment.', ""Police were called to the Shales' squalid, trash-strewn apartment on March 21, 2016, where officers found the infants malnourished and injured.

It's on the ceiling too."", '""The way the blood cast-off had been found on various patterns, especially on the ceiling,"" said Castor.', ""Detectives believe the blood-spatter patterns don't match up with a shotgun blast to the face. Their suspicions are confirmed."", 'Ellen Robb was innocently wrapping Christmas presents in her home outside of Philadelphia when someone attacked her and bludgeoned her to death.

It was not in conformity with what we thought the timeline was.""', 'That now makes it possible that Rafael was at home during the time his wife was ruthlessly slaughtered.', 'While investigators zero-in on Rafael, they lack one crucial piece of the puzzle: the murder weapon. A murder weapon is never recovered. Still, prosecutors move ahead with their case.', '""I arrested him and charged him with first-degree murder,"" said Castor.', ""But Castor doesn't believe Rafael is a cold-blooded killer."", '""I didn\'t think that it fit the evidence,"" said Castor. ""I had a written report from two psychiatrists, one psychologist and one psychiatrist, telling me that this was a \'rage killing.\' A rage killing, where the killer strikes more blows with more force far more than is necessary to bring about death. That tells us the type of mindset of the person we are looking for.""', 'Meaning Rafael Robb killed his wife, but in a sudden loss of control, not in a premeditated action.', ""Castor claims it is a crime of passion brought on by a triggering event. In this case he believes it is a conversation about Ellen's plans to leave Rafael."", '""He has a complete freak-out, grabs the nearest thing capable of producing death and then goes to town on her head,"" said Castor. ""But unless he admits he did it then I don\'t have any choice but to put on the evidence I do have.""', 'For the next 11 months Rafael Robb sits in jail on first-degree murder charges, facing life in prison and possibly the death penalty. He swears he is innocent.', '""Now I have a problem because I can\'t actually go and try to convince a jury that it\'s a first-degree case when I actually think it\'s voluntary-manslaughter case,"" said Castor.', 'Then, just before Rafael\'s case is set to go to trial, he cops to the brutal slaying of his wife. Rafael admits to prosecutors that he beat his wife\'s face in with a nearby chin-up bar. Then he staged the break-in and disposed of the weapon and bloody clothes in a trash bin in Chinatown. In his words, he just ""lost it"" when he learned Ellen planned to take their daughter to Massachusetts.', '""The facts that developed fit the forensics,"" said Castor.', ""Rafael's confession is game-changer for the state's case against him."", '""It no longer is a provable first-degree murder case, in my judgment, because remember, it\'s proof beyond a reasonable doubt,"" said Castor.', 'And prosecutors believe a crime of passion or rage killing creates enough doubt to derail a first-degree murder conviction, which requires proof of premeditation.', '""The district attorney, he stated there was a lot of circumstantial evidence, no murder weapon was found, and that he felt that it would give the family peace to accept a plea deal,"" said Ellen\'s brother Gary.', 'As part of a negotiated plea deal, Rafael pleads guilty to a voluntary manslaughter charge, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years.', 'But in a shocking decision by the court, the judge sentences Rafael Robb to a lesser sentence of just 10 years, and Rafael has a chance of parole after only five years.', ""Ellen's family is horrified by the verdict."", '""I argued that the facts and circumstances warranted the maximum sentence of 20 years, and the judge didn\'t agree and imposed the 10-year term,"" said Bruce Castor. ""I didn\'t expect him to do that.""', ""But it did happen and now Ellen's family has to live with the verdict and live without their loved one. And just as Ellen's family feared, Rafael Robb is set free after serving just five years behind bars."", '""It\'s remarkable to think that after serving only five of a five- to 10-year sentence, he was actually paroled by the Pennsylvania parole board,"" said Gregory.

Mike Vereb (R-Montgomery).', ""Rafael Robb is suddenly heading back to prison to finish out his full 10-year sentence. But Ellen's family is just getting started."", 'A new team of lawyers is on the case. And they say they have new evidence that changes everything.', ""Outraged by the light sentence, Ellen's family wants justice and moves ahead with their wrongful-death lawsuit filed during Rafael's attempt at a five-year parole. Ellen's family hires attorneys Andrew Duffy and Robert Mongeluzzi to represent their civil case."", '""The family came to us and asked us to prove that he premeditated the murder,"" said Duffy. And after reviewing the evidence, they think they have a strong case.', '""Anybody who did this to any human being, let alone his wonderful wife and mother of his only child, should spend every second of their life in jail, for the rest of their life, period,"" said Duffy.', ""The plaintiffs' attorneys break down the evidence that they presented to a civil jury. They start at the beginning: Rafael's phone call to police."", '""Rafael Robb did not call 911,"" said Robert Mongeluzzi. Robb called the direct police line. ""He didn\'t do that because he wanted to set up his alibi. He didn\'t want to be recorded, he would have known that 911 would record his call and his voice, and chose to call the local number.""', 'Another thing they say points to premeditation was the complete lack of blood evidence found on Rafael. Attorneys Duffy and Mongeluzzi argue, How in the world would that be possible in the middle of such a bloodbath?', '""He claimed that somehow after the murder in this slaughterhouse that he took off his shirt and his pants, his socks, and his shoes, somehow hopped across the blood-spattered floor to the hallway, went upstairs, found baby wipes, cleaned himself up, changed clothes, without a single drop of blood -- it was incredible implausible and an absolute lie,"" said Mongeluzzi.', ""They have their own theory to explain the lack of blood on Rafael -- and it's explosive new evidence."", '""He had a Tyvek suit and police found an additional Tyvek suit, a hazmat suit, in his BMW,"" said Mongeluzzi.', ""Make that two hazmat-style suits, according to the plaintiffs' attorneys. One suit used in the murder, and the other, a backup suit, Rafael Robb forgot to discard with the other evidence."", '""Tyvek suits, if Rafael Robb was a chemist, if he worked in an industrial plant, he would have a potential justification for having a Tyvek suit in his BMW,"" said Duffy. ""Rafael Robb was a professor of economics at the University of Pennsylvania. There was no rhyme or reason why he would have a Tyvek suit in the back of his BMW.', '""We proved that the blood trail stopped abruptly in the garage, and that only means a Tyvek suit was on, was taken off, was discarded, so the only thing left after the Tyvek was taken off was a blood-free murder,"" said Duffy.', ""Then there's the issue of the murder weapon, which was never recovered."", '""Rafael Robb claims that he began to argue with Ellen, he grabbed a chin-up bar. We could find no evidence there were any brackets for a chin-up bar. It seems implausible, and then he beat her to death with it,"" said Mongeluzzi. ""Those wounds that were found on Ellen Gregory Robb were sharp, lacerating wounds that are consistent with a sharp object such as a crowbar, and not a round chin-up bar.""', ""Then they enter into evidence pictures of the Robb's garage and the tools hanging on the walls."", '""We have a picture of all the tools lined up, and a crowbar happened to be missing,"" said Duffy. ""the physical facts pointed this was not a chin-up bar. This was absolutely a jagged edged instrument such as a crowbar.""', ""Which the plaintiffs' attorneys argue means he had to go find the weapon. It wasn't just nearby and grabbed in a fit of rage. It shows pre-thought and planning on Rafael's part. Also, they claim a crowbar-type weapon better explains the horrific damage done to Ellen's head."", '""I will never be able to get those photos out of my mind,"" said attorney Andrew Duffy. ""Ellen was unidentifiable. He had literally beaten her face in to remove her identity, and the pictures showed that.""', ""The civil trial lawyers then point to something obvious: Rafael Robb's job at the University of Pennsylvania. He's an economics professor who specializes in game theory. It is the science of logical decision-making involving strategic thinking and planning."", '""People who are proficient in game theory plan things out, they have backup plans,"" said Mongeluzzi.', '""This was a premeditated murder,"" said Duffy.', '""He had it all planned out, but he didn\'t plan on his story unraveling so quickly,"" said Mongeluzzi.', 'Then they introduce a letter written by Rafael to his daughter Olivia two years after the murder.', '""This is the letter that in hindsight was the single most important piece of the civil trial,"" said Duffy.', 'In the letter, Rafael is asking for photos of his daughter and the two of them together. He is hoping to show that he is a good father in order to receive a lighter punishment during the sentencing phase. In exchange, he promises to send her Christmas gifts and money.', 'With all this damning evidence, the civil trial kicks off. Attorney Robert Mongeluzzi comes out swinging in his opening remarks.', 'In civil court transcripts, he states:', 'Mongeluzzi: ""You are a killer and a liar, Mr. Robb, aren\'t you?""', 'Robb: ""Killer, yes, liar, too, yes.""', 'In one stunning courtroom exchange, it appears Rafael is blaming his wife for her own murder.', 'Robb: ""My wife pushed me.""', 'Mongeluzzi: ""So you\'re claiming to this jury that Ellen provoked you into murdering her, is that right?""', 'Robb: ""She pushed me. I got angry. I lost my faculties. That\'s what happened.""', ""Then plaintiffs' attorneys call their star witness: Olivia Robb, now 20 years old.

Cosby now faces criminal charges in the case.', ""Cosby attorneys said he only answered deposition questions because Bruce Castor, the district attorney at the time, promised to never bring a criminal case based on Constand's allegations. Constand was a former employee at Cosby's alma mater, Temple University."", 'Castor said he made that promise so the entertainer would not be able to use the Fifth Amendment to avoid answering questions in a deposition, according to an email from Castor to his successor, Risa Vetri Ferman. The civil suit was the best chance Constand had for finding justice, the Castor email said.', 'The current district attorney, Kevin Steele, responded in court documents that a formal nonprosecution agreement never existed, just a press release. He also said this kind of immunity can only be extended to a witness, not a defendant.', ""In issuing the order, Judge Steven O'Neill said a promise to not prosecute Cosby in the future did not exist based upon the evidence presented in court."", 'This is the first time Cosby has faced criminal prosecution. He is charged with three counts of felony aggravated indecent assault from a 2004 case involving Constand.', 'She said she went to his home in a Philadelphia suburb for a career consultation and he gave her a mix of pills and wine that left her incapacitated and unable to consent to sex.', 'The criminal case against Cosby is based partly on the 2005 deposition. In that testimony, he said the sexual encounter with Constand was consensual. Portions of that deposition were unsealed for the first time in 2015 after a lawsuit by The Associated Press that paved the way, prosecutors said, for re-opening the 2005 criminal investigation against Cosby in Pennsylvania.', 'In the deposition, Cosby said he had sexual relationships with at least five women outside his marriage, gave prescription sedatives to women he wanted to have sex with and tried to hide the affairs from his wife. He said he first met Constand at a Temple athletic facility when he showed her a back-relaxation technique, according to the deposition.', 'When asked how Cosby developed a romantic relationship with Constand, he said he acted as a mentor, by “inviting her to my house, talking to her about personal situations dealing with her life, growth, education access and thoughts to how to acquire a more aggressive attitude, protecting oneself in business,” according to the deposition.', ""In the current criminal case, Montgomery County's district attorney has asked O'Neill to allow the testimony of 13 women who say Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted them from 1964 to 2002 to be included as evidence in the criminal case. O'Neill has not decided on the request. A hearing is scheduled for December 13 and 14."", 'The motion to show “prior bad acts of defendant” states, “what became clear was that the defendant has engaged, over the course of a lifetime, in a pattern of serial sexual abuse.” It does not name the women but provides their ages, when they met Cosby and how their relationship with Cosby developed.', ""Rule 404(b) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence allows prosecutors to call witnesses about a defendant's previous conduct if it is substantially similar to the trial at hand."", ""Cosby's trial is scheduled to begin on June 5, 2017.

It was never checked,"" said Radner.', 'The second clue: A muddy footprint found on the back of the jacket Abe was wearing', ""Maybe one of the investigators or one of the first-responders or someone there, it could've accidentally happened?"", '""The likelihood of a first-responder accidentally stepping on a dead person, I think is about as absurd as the conclusion that this was suicide,"" said Radner.', ""Radner says both the footprint and the hair could be those of Abe's killer."", '""Most likely what happened was someone who was an expert shot him through his window, which is why it was shattered,"" said Radner. ""His car then flipped over and went in a ditch, the killer then went to the scene, left footprints on the window and on his jacket, retrieved that bullet, and this person then shot Abe\'s gun so that a bullet would be found.""', 'But Redding Police Chief Douglas Fuchs denies every accusation in the lawsuit and stands by the official finding: ""It does not appear that anyone else was involved, and that the gunshot wound was self-inflicted.""', '""There is every indication that nobody else was in the vehicle and whatever took place, took place within the vehicle,"" said Fuchs.', '""So the office of the state\'s attorney is taking over the investigation at this point, hoping to release their findings soon,"" said reporter Lorenzo Hall.', ""Now Abe's friends and family can only hope they will learn the truth in court."", 'In response to our Crime Watch Daily story, the state\'s attorney in Danbury tells us in part: ""Although the investigation is not yet complete, it has revealed no evidence of any conspiracy on the part of the Redding Police Department.

The victim slept through much of the flight, but she was awakened when she felt De Jesumaria wrap his arm around her body and grab her breast. For a period of time, the defendant had a tight grip on the woman, but when his grip relaxed, she got up and went to the bathroom. The victim used a call button to summon a flight attendant and reported that the De Jesumaria had been touching her inappropriately.', ""The flight crew re-seated De Jesumaria in the front of the plane in a seat between two male passengers, according to trial testimony. The airplane's captain requested law enforcement meet the plane after it landed at Los Angeles International Airport. FBI agents subsequently interviewed De Jesumaria, who admitted he enjoyed “cozy flights” with women."", ""The victim spoke at Monday's sentencing hearing and described the “fear, frustration, and anxiety” the crime has caused. She said she is reminded of the “ordeal” daily, as she must travel regularly on airplanes for her job."", ""In papers filed in relation to Monday's sentencing, prosecutors wrote that De Jesumaria's “testimony at trial provided numerous bizarre explanations for his conduct and blamed the victim.” They wrote that De Jesumaria testified that he considered his touching of the victim was “consensual because she did not reject his touches and he interpreted her silence, because she was asleep, as 'coyness.'”"", 'The case against De Jesumaria was investigated by the FBI.', ""SOURCE: U.S. Justice Dept.: U.S. Attorney's Office"", 'Waiting for your permission to load facebook comments.', 'Sign up to receive breaking True Crime Daily news, exclusive stories and behind-the-scenes info.', '© 2022 Telepictures Productions Inc.
